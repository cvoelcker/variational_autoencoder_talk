# Lecture on Variational Autoencoder

These are the slides for my variational autoencoder lecture, which I gave as part of the lecture on deep generative models at TU Darmstadt in the summer of 2019.

The focus is on the derivation of the ELBO and the struture of the basic variational autoencoder, with some notes on applications.

Feel free to use the slides, if you credit me ^^
